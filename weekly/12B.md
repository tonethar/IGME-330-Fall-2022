## II. Quick Demos
- #1 - To get the smoothest canvas animations, and to account for the differing frame rates that [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) gives you depending on the machine (and monitor) your JS is running on, it's best to calculate a "delta time" to use when drawing animations, and to also consider pausing/unpausing your animations (esp. for a game) when the window goes out of focus:
  - see demos here: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/shared/330/canvas/smooth-animation/
  - and also they are zipped up in myCourses
- #2 - Interested in sprites, vector movement and loading images?
    - see **sprity-HW-done.html.zip** demo in myCourses
- #3 - DatGUI - Mimimalist UI
    - working link is here --> http://igm.rit.edu/~acjvks/courses/shared/330/demos/datGUI-demo/
    - files are in myCourses
