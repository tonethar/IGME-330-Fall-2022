   - AV Tips - [../projects/p2-overview-and-tips.md#av-tips](../projects/p2-overview-and-tips.md#av-tips)
   - Game Tips - [../projects/p2-overview-and-tips.md#v-game-tips](../projects/p2-overview-and-tips.md#v-game-tips)
   - "Mashup" Tips (for example, *Web Audio/Platformer Game*, *Web Audio/Rhythm Game*, *Random Music Dungeon Level Generator*):
     - in the past (which is not a guarantee of future performance) many web audio mashup projects have not come together very well
     - consider implementing ONE of the "mashees" well, FIRST. And then SECOND, add the other "mashee" into the project.
     - example: Build a solid platformer first, with 2 or 3 levels, moving platforms, hazards, goals etc. Give it a kickin' sound track. THEN add in some peril with WebAudio spawning platforms, hazards, etc
   - PoseNet "Mashups":
     - Similarly, consider implementing the falling sand or falling fruit etc of the mashup FIRST, and then add PoseNet in later
