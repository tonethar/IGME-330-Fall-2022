# Week 11A - "Creative Coding" with Canvas

## I. Animating Periodic Functions & Algorithmic Botany

- In-class Activity/Checkoffs:
  - [HW - Sine Wave](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-sine-wave.md)
  - [HW - Algorithmic Botany](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-algorithmic-botany.md) 
- see myCourses for due dates

## II. Extra Credit Opportunities - You MUST complete at least ONE of these 
- Three extra credit assignments - these are potential Project 2 "starters":
  - they are all bonus "extra credit" items
  - see myCourses for due dates
  - ***you MUST do at least ONE of them (but you can do all three if you want, for <u>super power-up credits & achievements</u>!)***
  - here they are (for your edification):
    - [Extra Credit - Random Walker](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-random-walker.md)
    - [Extra Credit - Conway's Life](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-canvas-life.md)
    - [Extra Credit - Lorenz Attractor](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-lorenz-attractor.md)
  - PS - these three assignments individually count as "1/2" of an extra credit HW assignment (Do all 3, and they are worth in aggregate 1.5 of a HW assignment in extra credit)

## III. *Optional* Extra Credit Opportunity - *Nick Cage Clicker*

- This is a potential "starter" for a Project 2 Game - you would need to do all 4 parts to receive the full extra credit:
