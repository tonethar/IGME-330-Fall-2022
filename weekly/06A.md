# Week 6A

## I. Review Quiz #2

### Part A - String Production 
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join
- BTW - in general, don't use `array.map()` as if it's `array.forEach()`, these methods do different things

### Part B - Adding structure to data
- XML syntax rules:
  - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-3.md#ii-about-xml
  - N.B. - don't worry about having to remember the XML declaration at the top of an XML file! This is because it is not required if the document is either UTF-8 or UTF-16 format
- JSON syntax rules:
  - https://www.json.org/json-en.html
  - https://medium.com/omarelgabrys-blog/json-in-a-nutshell-7d638dfea7cc
  - N.B. - the "root" of a valid JSON file can be either `{ }` OR `[ ]` - but the former is more common
  - In JSON, ALL object keys MUST be strings and MUST be quoted (unlike a JS object literal)
  - BTW - when creating your own JSON files, you don't need to make it deliberately harder to parse like we did with **pet-names.json** in [HW - Ajax-4 - loading and parsing JSON files](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-4.md)


### Part C - ES6 Modules
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export

### Part D - Bulma
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-bulma-1.md

### Part E - Web Components
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-1.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-2.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-3.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md
- We "wrapped up" Web Components on [Week 5A](./05A.md#ii-finish-up-web-components)
- We also covered *slots* on [Week 5B](./05B.md)

### Part F - JavaScript Events
- https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/blackout-poetry-maker.md
- https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing
- Also fair game on the exam - custom events: [HW - Web Components-5 - Dispatching Custom Events](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md)

### Part G - Fix the Code
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#strict_mode_for_modules
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts
- *on the exam, you could be asked about CSS selectors (type, class, id, attribute) - so know what they are and be sure you can write a simple CSS rule using them*
- *you should also understand variable block scoping that `let` and `const` use - and that a variable declared with these can't be accessed until AFTER it has been declared*:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block

### Part H - Be a human linter
- https://eslint.org/demo

## II. Project 1 - Checkpoints
- [Project 1 - HTML5 App of Awesomeness - Checkpoint #1 - *Proposal & Mockup*](../projects/p1-checkpoint-1.md)
  - See dropbox for due date

## III. CORS, Authentication & Proxy Servers
- What is a [Proxy Server](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-proxy-server-in-english-please/) ?
  - "A proxy server is a computer system or router that functions as a relay between client and server."
    - is necessary if the web service has not enabled CORS
    - is a good place to "hide" your API key from users who know how to "view source" ...
    - and to hide the end user's IP address from the web service vendor
    - also good if the web service requires server-side authentication via HTTP headers - ex. [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)
- Sample code & links: look in the myCourses content section under "CORS"
  - iTunes Search API example
  - Yelp API Authentication Example
- MOST of you don't need to worry about this issue for Project 1, and will not need to set up a Proxy Server, but this is still good to be aware of

## IV. Test your API!
- Head to myCourses and grab a fresh copy of the "API Tester" file we used last week
- Get this working with your Project 1 API - when the "Load Data" button is clicked - some of the API data is written to the `#output` <div> in the window so that we can see that you can get your API functioning in a web browser
- IF your app is using a JS library (such a RiTa.js), or if it using a hard-coded "data source" (something from the [corpora list](../projects/p1-data-sources.md#i-non-api-sources-csv-et-al) for example) - you still need to do this assignment. But instead of using `XHR` to load data when the "Load Data" button is clicked , instead load in some data from the data source and display it on the page
- See myCourses dropbox for submission instructions
