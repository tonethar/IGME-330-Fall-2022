# Week 6B

## I. Exam #1
- Will be given next Thursday (week 7B)
- The format will be very similar to Quiz #2
- Question types include: short answer, true/false, "write some code" & multiple choice
- The exam is completely closed-computer, closed-book and closed-notes.  Open brain only.
- Don't forget to bring a pencil and/or pen!
- Everything we have covered this semester up through and including today is fair game
- If you have accommodations and prefer to take the exam at the testing center, have them contact me ASAP and I will send them the exam
