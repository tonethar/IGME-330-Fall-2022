# Week 6B

## I. Exam #1
- Will be given next Thursday (week 7B)
- The format will be very similar to Quiz #2
- Question types include: short answer, true/false, "write some code" & multiple choice
- The exam is completely closed-computer, closed-book and closed-notes.  Open brain only.
- Don't forget to bring a pencil and/or pen!
- Everything we have covered this semester up through and including today is fair game
- If you have accommodations and prefer to take the exam at the testing center, have them contact me ASAP and I will send them the exam

## II. Ajax Demos (fils in myCourses)
- The XHR Helper function demo shows how to simplify your code if you are calling more than one API endpoint
- The XHR "chained" ajax calls shows how to:
  - make a call to an endpoint of your project API
  - get a response from that API and parse the data
  - and then use some of that parsed data to make another ajax call to a different endpoint of the API
  - and when that data shows up, make another API call
  - and so on until you're done
