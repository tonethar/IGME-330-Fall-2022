## III. Node.js

- **Node.js** is a command-line JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world
  - https://nodejs.org/en/
- Node.js runs on your local machine via the command line, or on a server, it does not run in the user's browser
- What can it do?
  - Run scripts and utilities on your local machine
  - Run web servers, sockets servers, etc out there on the interwebs
  - And much more!
- Let's try out writing some simple local scripts first
  - "Code along" - *Consuming Web Services from a command-line Node.js app*:
