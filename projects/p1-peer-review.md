## Instructions


## Peer review questions

### I. All Pages
- Is there a "global" navbar on the same place on each page, and does it have embedded "you are here" cues (current page text is bolded, or similar)?
- Does the Hamburger menu still work?
- Is there a custom "brand" icon present (or is the app still using the font awesome dog icon)?
- Does each page have appropriate `<title>` tag content (or is the app still using content from the Dogfinder app)?
- Does the app still look like Dogfinder app (same colors etc) - or is it distinctive in some way?
- Naming conventions followed for file and folder names and HTML element class/id names?
- [Code style guide](330-code-style.md) followed?

### II. Home Page
- App's name or title?
- 2 or 3 sentence description of the project?
- Theme related image?

### III. App Page

### IV. Favorites Page

### V. Documentation Page
- [Required Content Present?](p1-checkpoint-2.md#v-content-requirements---aboutdocumentation-page)

### VI. Web Components
- Are there 4 components - "result-card", "app-navbar" and others?
- Is the `<result-card>` following the `<sw-card>` example from **wc-3**, or the **Dogfinder-3** card example that uses Bulma card styles (which looks much better, and shows how to pass in callback code to the "Favorite" button)?


### VII. "Above and Beyond"
- Is there any current or planned "above and beyond"?


### VIII. Overall comments or suggestions from reviewer
