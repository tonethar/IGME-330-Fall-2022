# Week 12B - Mostly "Catch up"

## I - Today's Notes
- Project 2:
  - Discussion thread for Project 2 idea is in myCourses and closes Thursday night at 11:59PM
  - Let's take a quick look at some more examples
- To get the smoothest canvas animations, and to account for the differing frame rates that [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) gives you depending on the machine (and monitor) your JS is running on, it's best to calculate a "delta time" to use when drawing animations, and to also consider pausing/unpausing your animations (esp. for a game) when the window goes out of focus:
  - see demos here: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/shared/330/canvas/smooth-animation/
  - and also they are zipped up in myCourses
- Interested in sprites, vector movement and loading images?
  - see **sprity-HW-done.html.zip** demo in myCourses
- Now, we head back to  [**Week 12A Notes**](12A.md)
