# Week 5A - Finish up Web Components

## I. Practice Quiz/Exam

- Hand in *Quiz #2 Extra Credit* - if you forgot to bring it today - get it slid under my office door (GOL-2525) prior to 6PM today and I will accept it
- I will grade them and hand them back in a week
- When's the midterm exam? Thursday October 6th (week 7)
  - It's a written exam (no practical)
  - Format will be very similar to Quiz #2
  - What's on it? Everything we cover through the end of week 6 is "fair game"
  - If you have accomodations (such as 1.5x time) you will need to schedule that with DSO

## II. Project 1
- [Project 1 - HTML5 App of Awesomeness - Checkpoint #1 - *Proposal & Mockup*](../projects/p1-checkpoint-1.md)
- [Project 1 - HTML5 App of Awesomeness - Checkpoint #2 - *Working Prototype*](../projects/p1-checkpoint-2.md)
- [Project 1 - HTML5 App of Awesomeness - Final Deliverable](../projects/p1-final.md)
  - See myCourses dropboxes (the Projects category at the bottom) for due dates
- [Dogfinder - Part I](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/dogfinder-1.md) - this is your "starter" for Project 1
- Look at some previous project 1 examples

## II-1/2. Web UI Frameworks
- ***The career fair is this week - some of you might get asked if you "know React"***
- React - *A JavaScript library for building user interfaces*:
  - https://reactjs.org/
  - https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
  - Linked in Learning:
    - https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-essential-training-14836121
    - https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-essential-training-14888164
  - let's take a look at a couple of React examples - see the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file in myCourses
- Vue.js - *A JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.*:
  - https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
  - let's take a look at the **counter-vue** example in the **web-component-wrap-up.zip** file 

## III. Finish up Web Components

- [HW - Web Components-4 - Walk through a `<my-list>` component](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-4.md)
  - demos `set`/`get` in a web component
  - PS - web components use JS `class` syntax - so their instances are regular JS objects - and can do anything JS objects/classes can do
  - it lets us pass reference types (arrays/object) normally
- [HW - Web Components-5 - Dispatching Custom Events](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-5.md)
- More thoughts on Web Components:
  - Slots
    - *unnamed* slots work well if you only have one value to pass in
    - *named* slots let you easily "plug in" 2 or more values into multiple locations in your HTML template
    - if you have a large amount of text and HTML content, you should use slots instead of attributes (one advantage: the text will be easier to read and format in a slot)
  - Attributes
    - "named" by default - work well when the passed in values are short in length
  - Slots & attributes are both easy for you to edit (and also for non-programmers to edit them, like in a CMS!)
  - Of course you can mix slots and attributes in the same component. Consider this: the slots of a particular element should contain the "main content" about it, and the attributes would be contain the "meta data" about that element (think about how a typical HTML tag might be structured with both text content and attribute values)
  - When to consider using custom JS properties instead of the above (like we did in wc-5):
    - your component is not being embedded in an HTML file and is instead being created dynamically in code
    - you are passing in an array to an attribute (remember that it gets *stringified*, and then we have to later `split()` it to use it)
    - you are passing in a lot of string attributes - when instead you could pass in a single object reference instead:
      - think about `<sw-card>` and its 6+ attributes  - it might have been better to just pass in an object reference that contained all of the character data

## IV. An alternative to custom events - the "Pub/Sub" pattern

- [Web Components-6 - Building a "pubsub" object aka "Publish/Subscribe"](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-wc-6.md) (NOT assigned as HW)

<hr>

## V. `fetch()`

- [HW - Ajax-5 - the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-5.md)
- [HW - Ajax-6 - async & await with the fetch() API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-ajax-6.md)
- Head to myCourses and grab the "API Tester" files - let's quickly review/practice parsing a web service
