# Week 7A

## I. Midterm Exam is next time
- Will be given next class (Thursday 7B)
- The format will be very similar to [Quiz #2](06A.md#i-review-quiz-2)
- Question types include: short answer, true/false, "write some code" & multiple choice
- The exam is completely closed-computer, closed-book and closed-notes.  Open brain only.
- Don't forget to bring a pencil and/or pen!
- Everything we have covered this semester up through and including today is fair game:
  - Review notes for [Quiz #1](./04A.md#i-review-quiz-1)
  - Review notes for [Quiz #2](./06A.md#i-review-quiz-2)
  - What have we covered since Quiz #2? Here is the major stuff (be sure to review the notes/exercises):
    - Maps-1 & Map-2
    - The `fetch` api on Ajax-5, Ajax-6 and Ajax-7
    - [Web Component properties and custom events](./04B.md#iii-web-components)
    - [Component *slots*](05A.md#iii-finish-up-web-components)
    - [Dogfinder II](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/dogfinder-2.md) - be sure to review it
  - What WON'T I ask you about on this exam?
    - [Web Component Frameworks like React and Vue](./05A.md#iii-finish-up-web-components)
    - [Pub/Sub Pattern](./05A.md#iv-an-alternative-to-custom-events---the-pubsub-pattern)
    - Firebase
- If you have accommodations and prefer to take the exam at the testing center, have them contact me ASAP and I will send them the exam

## III. `localStorage` Demo
- This could be a nice helper for the P1 Checkpoint #2 requirements
- ***You should complete this demo (favorites.js needs some work to be fully functional) and are free to borrow all of the code and layout from it, but do not use this demo as a "starter" for Project 1***
- Look for **local-storage-demo-start.zip** in myCourses
- Bulma stuff
  - Both HTML pages:
    - navbar with functional mobile navigation and "you are here" cues
    - pass HTML validation with no errors or warning
    - `<hotdog-footer>` web component - note that it uses `<slot>`s and the code contains only a constructor, as it does not need any other lifecycle or helper methods
  - **app.html**
    - has a 2-column layout
    - Bulma [`.box`](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/box/) class
    - styles the buttons with Bulma
    - styles the width of the text inputs with a regular CSS *attribute selector*
- ES6 modules stuff:
  - all `<script>` tags are of `type=module` and are all located in the `<head>` section of the document
  - all JS passes [ESLint](https://eslint.org/demo)
  - there is a **loader.js** file, linked to from both HTML pages,  for importing the `<hotdog-footer>` component and hamburger code
  - each HTML page is its own *application* with distinct functionality, therefore each page will load its own JS file 
    - **app.js** is loaded by the **app.html** page and does "appy things"
    - **favorites.js** is loaded by the **favorites.html** page and does "favority things"
  - there is a **eslintrc.json** file in a **_dev** folder - the app doesn't need it for anything - it's just there for reference 
- `localStorage` stuff:
  - there is a **localStorage.js** file that contains utility functions that help with accessing `localStorage`
    - 2 of these functions are "private" and not visible from outside of the module
    - 7 of the functions are "public" and can be imported and used in other modules
  - **app.js** links to this file. On this page we have functionality that allows the user to change the title of the web site in localStorage, as well as add items to the favorites list.
  - **favorites.js** also links to **localStorage.js**, and has functionality for reading and displaying the favorites, emptying the favorites list, and resetting the app title to the  default value. **favorites.html** will automatically load and display the contents of the `favorites` array from `localStorage` when the user navigates to the page
- more `localStorage` stuff (not needed for P1)
  - uses a `window.onstorage` event handler to communicate between tabs and windows that `localStorage` has changed, and update the window or tab immediately
- Don't forget about our IGME-235 tutorial [Web Apps 9 - WebStorage API](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-9.md)
