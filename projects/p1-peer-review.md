## Instructions


## Peer review questions

### I. All Pages
- Is there a "global" navbar on the same place on each page, and does it have embedded "you are here" cues (current page text is bolded, or similar)?
- Does the Hamburger menu still work?
- Is there a custom "brand" icon present (or is the app still using the font awesome dog icon)?
- Does each page have appropriate <title> tag content (or is the app still using content from the Dogfinder app)?
- Does the app still look like Dogfinder app (same colors etc)

### II. Home Page

### III. App Page

### IV. Favorites Page

### V. Documentation Page

### VI. Web Components
- Are there 4 components - "result-card", "app-navbar" and others
- Is the <result-card> following the <sw-card> example from wc-3, or the Dogfinder-3 card example that uses Bulma card styles (which looks much better, and shows how to pass in callback code to the "Favorite" button)?


### VII. "Above and Beyond"
- Is there any current or planned "above and beyond"?


### VIII. Overall comments or suggestions from reviewer
