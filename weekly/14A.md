- If you are scheduled to take the exam on 12/13, but this interferes with your travel plans, you may request to take the exam on one of the 12/8 times, but you must request to do so *in advance, by DMing me in Slack prior to the start of our next class meeting*
- Be sure to indicate which 12/8 time you are interested in!
